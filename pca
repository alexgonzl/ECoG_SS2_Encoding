analysis of correlations of pca components:
PCCAtrialDecomp.CorrStudyRTs<=thr,2)

-> select maximum and min correlations per channel. if channel doesn't have a positive or negative correlation it is excluded from analysis
	[~,ids] = max(data.PCAtrialDecomp.CorrStudyRTs,[],2)
	[~,ids] = min(data.PCAtrialDecomp.CorrStudyRTs,[],2)
